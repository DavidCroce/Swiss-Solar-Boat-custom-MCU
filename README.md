## `begin(long baudrate)`

This function initializes the CAN functionality of the microcontroller and sets up the transmit and receive parameters. It configures the transmit and receive buffers, sets up the acceptance filter, and enables the CAN controller. It also sets up the CAN interrupt to handle incoming messages.

## Parameters
- `baudrate`: The communication speed of the CAN bus, specified in bits per second.

## Return value
- Returns 1 if the initialization was successful, or 0 if it failed.
